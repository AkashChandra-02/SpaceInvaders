This is a project for a PLTW POE class, where I worked on a team with two other people. 
We were supposed to use Vex (A microcontroller) to create an arcade game.   
The CAD files are the game pieces and the Code.c file is for the game.  
 
The game plays along these lines:
1. Player rolls ball, trying to hit the target at the end of the board.
2. Each obstacle the player hits is one point, and the targets are worth two points.   
3. The LED strip lights up at the end of the game if the target is hit. 
4. The score is displayed in binary on a chart. 
  
The project documentation (Engineering Notebook) is attached.
